Thank you for the kind words regarding my hat!  :-)

Also, nice use of the Random class to generate a random number.  One minor
suggestion...if you want the random number "between 0 and 100" to possibly
include 100 (as it includes 0), you will need to actually request 
rand.Next(0, 101), as the Next() method takes an inclusive lower bound
and an exclusive upper bound (that is, the lower bound is a possible
response value, but the upper bound is not).  See 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2dx6wyd4.aspx for details.

Of course, you could reasonably argue that "between 0 and 100" should not
include the value "100", since, after all, in C#'s implementation of 
Random, it doesn't...
